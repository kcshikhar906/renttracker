# Firebase App Hosting Configuration
# This file tells Firebase how to build and run your application.
# For a Vite project, we want to build the static site and serve it.

kind: "apphosting"
schemaVersion: "v1"

# Build configuration
# Firebase will automatically run 'npm run build' if it detects a package.json
# We specify where the build output is located.
# Note: App Hosting currently expects a server for some configurations,
# but providing a clear start command or using a supported framework is key.

runConfig:
  # App Hosting expects a process to listen on the port defined by $PORT
  # For static Vite apps, we can use a simple node server to serve 'dist'
  command: "npm run start"

# Environment variables can be added here if needed
# env:
#   - variable: API_URL
#     value: "https://your-api.com"
